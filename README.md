# Hi, I’m Kayla Rieck

I’m a computer science student in Seattle interested in creative computing, simulation, GPU compute, and emergent systems.  
I build experimental and interactive software where simple rules create complex behavior, often using Rust, Bevy, and WGSL compute shaders.

My interests include:
- Agent-based modeling  
- Emergent behavior  
- GPU compute and parallelism  
- Real-time rendering  
- Procedural generation  
- Interactive systems and creative tools  

I’m currently preparing a portfolio of simulation and graphics projects and exploring opportunities in creative technology, R&D, and interactive systems.

## Featured Projects

### Ant Pheromone Simulation  
GPU-accelerated multi-species slime simulation using WGSL compute shaders and Rust/Bevy.  
Emergent trail-following and pheromone-based behavior.

### Boids / Flocking Simulation  
Boids implementation running entirely on the GPU through compute shaders, supporting thousands of agents in real time.
